# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project

This project focuses on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques specifically for processing the Korean language. Korean presents unique linguistic challenges, such as morphological complexity, agglutination, and honorifics, which require specialized approaches.

## Project Overview

The repository contains Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) that cover various stages of NLP tasks including tokenization, text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and document similarity analysis. The goal is to provide hands-on experience with NLP tools while addressing the intricacies of Korean text data.

## Features

This project demonstrates the following Korean NLP tasks:

- **Tokenization**: Breaking down Korean sentences into words or morphemes.
- **Morphological Analysis**: Analyzing the form and structure of words, including root identification and grammatical endings.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the sentiment of a given text (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying named entities such as people, places, and organizations.
- **TF-IDF and Document Similarity**: Calculating Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for documents and measuring the cosine similarity between documents.

Each task is illustrated in separate Jupyter Notebooks with detailed explanations and code.

## Installation
